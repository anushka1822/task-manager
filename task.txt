🎯 Objective
Design and build a complete, production-ready, full-stack Task Management application. This
assessment evaluates your ability to implement core application logic, ensure data integrity, and
handle real-time communication using modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices across the
frontend and backend.
⚙ Technical Specifications (The Stack)
To ensure a consistent and modern development environment, please adhere to the following
technologies:
Layer Technology Requirement
Frontend React (via Vite or Next.js
Pages Router)
Must use TypeScript and
Tailwind CSS.
Data Fetching SWR or React Query Mandatory for managing
server state and caching.
Backend Node.js + Express (with
TypeScript)
Must implement a clear
service/repository pattern.
Database PostgreSQL or MongoDB Choose one and justify the
selection in your README.
ORM/ODM Prisma (Highly
Recommended) or
Mongoose
Use an industry-standard
library for database
interaction.
Real-Time Socket.io Mandatory for
collaboration features.
Deployment Vercel/Netlify (FE) +
Render/Railway (BE/DB)
Mandatory live deployment.
🧹 Core Requirements (Must Haves)
1. User Authentication & Authorization
●
Secure Auth: Implement user registration and login. Passwords must be hashed (e.g., using
bcrypt).
●
●
Session Management: Implement session handling, preferably using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies).
User Profiles: Allow users to view and update their name/profile information.
2. Task Management (CRUD)
Implement full CRUD operations for tasks. A task must include the following attributes:
●
title (string, max 100 chars)
●
description (string, multi-line)
●
dueDate (date/time)
●
priority (Enum: Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
●
status (Enum: To Do, In Progress, Review, Completed)
●
creatorId (The ID of the user who created the task)
●
assignedToId (The ID of the registered user currently responsible for the task)
3. Real-Time Collaboration (Mandatory)
Implement real-time updates using Socket.io:
●
Live Updates: When a task's status, priority, or assignee is updated by any user, all other users
currently viewing the task list or dashboard must see the change instantly.
●
Assignment Notification: Send an instant, persistent in-app notification to a user when a task is
assigned to them.
4. User Dashboard & Data Exploration
●
●
Personal Views: A dedicated dashboard page showing:
○
Tasks assigned to the current user.
○
Tasks created by the current user.
○
Tasks that are Overdue (based on the dueDate).
Filtering & Sorting: Implement filtering on the task list based on Status and Priority. Implement
sorting by Due Date.
🏗 Engineering & Architecture Quality
The evaluation will heavily weigh how you approach the engineering challenge:
1. Backend Reliability
●
●
●
Clear Architecture: Use a proper architecture (e.g., MVC-like separation, with dedicated
Controllers, Services, and Repositories/Data Access Layers).
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Implement DTOs (using Zod or Class Validator) for input
validation on all API endpoints (e.g., CreateTaskDto, UpdateTaskDto).
Error Handling: Implement consistent and meaningful HTTP status codes and error responses for
failed requests (e.g., 401 for unauthorized, 404 for not found, 400 for validation errors).
2. Frontend UX & Data Management
●
●
Responsive UI: The application must be fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and
mobile views (using Tailwind CSS).
Loading States: Implement visible Skeleton Loading States (or similar smooth transitions) when
fetching data using SWR/React Query.
●
Form Management: Use a dedicated library (e.g., React Hook Form, Formik) with validation (e.g.,
Zod, Yup) for task creation/editing forms.
3. Code Quality & Testing
●
TypeScript Usage: Utilize strong typing throughout the application (both FE and BE) to enforce
●
●
type safety.
Documentation: Add JSDoc/TSDoc comments for complex functions, data models, and API
endpoints.
Mandatory Testing: Implement at least 3 unit tests for a critical piece of backend business logic
(e.g., the service function that handles task creation validation, or the WebSocket logic for
assignment). Use Jest or Mocha.
✉ Submission & Deliverables
Please submit the following through your designated submission portal:
Google Form Link to submit the assignment : https://forms.gle/fv1uZuya2jQR4bK76
1.
Public Git Repository Link: (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
○
The repository must have a clear commit history demonstrating a logical development
process.
○
Code must be organized into clear frontend/ and backend/ directories.
2.
Live Deployed Project Link(s): (Frontend URL and Backend API URL, if separate)
3. Comprehensive README.md file containing:
○
Setup instructions (how to run the FE/BE locally).
○
API Contract documentation (list of key endpoints: e.g., POST /api/v1/tasks).
○
Architecture Overview & Design Decisions (e.g., Why you chose your DB, how you handled
JWT, how you implemented the service layer).
○
A brief explanation of how Socket.io was integrated for real-time functionality.
○
Any trade-offs or assumptions made.
